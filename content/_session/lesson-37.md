  - I&rsquo;m here to check out.
  - ^Great sir! How was your stay?
  - It ^could&rsquo;ve been much ^better.
  - May I ^ask how it could&rsquo;ve been better?
  - I ^thought my room included ^breakfast but you ^charged me for breakfast. The room next door was really ^loud. I ^called the front desk about it, but they didn&rsquo;t do anything about it.
  - I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that sir.
  - And my TV didn&rsquo;t work. I ^wanted to watch the game, but I ^missed it.
  - May we offer you a ^discount ^coupon. That sounds like a ^terrible ^experience.
  - I guess that ^would be ok. I hope next time is much, much better.
