  - Today is the first day of ^school. I need to take a photo for my mother.
  - What is she going to need that for?
  - We have always taken a ^picture of us the first day of school. Every year since I was a kid.
  - ^Really? That&rsquo;s cool and what do you do with them?
  - Nothing, but my ^parents have ^frames with our pictures from every year at home.
  - Why don&rsquo;t you take one of me too. I&rsquo;ll send it to my mom.
  - Sounds great!
