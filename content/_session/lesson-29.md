  - I just ^cleaned out my ^purse. It was ^getting too ^heavy to ^carry.
  - What do you keep in that purse? What do you keep in it that ^weighs so much? ^Money?
  - I wish. I had ^fourteen ^pens and ^several ^lipsticks. They grow in there if I didn&rsquo;t keep ^emptying it out.
  - It must be a ^pain to ^carry a ^purse ^everywhere. I just have my ^wallet.
  - Actually, I enjoy having what I need with me. It just gets out of hand ^sometimes.
  - Oh, really?
  - Yeah, so I ^cleaned it out and I&rsquo;m good to go.
