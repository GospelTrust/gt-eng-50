  - When I ^woke up I just ^felt really ^tired. I ^couldn&rsquo;t get out of bed.
  - But we had a test. You ^missed it.
  - Oh no. I ^didn&rsquo;t ^remember we had a test.
  - Do you think I can take it again?
  - I don&rsquo;t know. ^Our ^teacher is very ^strict.

  - Maybe if you tell the teacher that you were ^sick, he&rsquo;ll let you take the test.
  - I&rsquo;ll ask him today.
