  - We&rsquo;re ^looking for the ^airport. Do you know where it is?
  - I do. I just ^flew in yesterday. I think I can help you.
  - We got off the ^freeway at the last street and I think we&rsquo;re close.
  - You are within ^several ^blocks of the road that will take you there. Will you also need to park your car?
  - No. We&rsquo;ll be ^returning it. It&rsquo;s a ^rental car.
  - I&rsquo;m glad you said that. You&rsquo;ll need to drive to a ^different ^location.
  - Is it ^far?
  - No, but it&rsquo;s on the ^other side of the ^airport ^terminals.
  - Great! How do I get there?
  - Do you have a ^city ^map?
  - No
  - Ok. Turn left at the next ^major street. And follow the signs to the ^rental ^agency.
  - Great! Thank you! Have a nice day!
