  - Late! Why?  You ^still have 15 (fifteen) ^minutes. That&rsquo;s ^plenty of time.
  - No it isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s ^Tuesday. Today there is so much ^traffic.
  - How long does it ^normally ^take to get ^there?
  - Normally it takes 10 ^minutes. But if ^there&rsquo;s traffic it&rsquo;ll take more than 30 (thirty) minutes. A ^half an ^hour!
  - Well, since you were already late, why not just stay here? Can you miss your ^meeting?
  - Yeah, it&rsquo;s not that ^important. I&rsquo;ll just call them and tell them that I ^won&rsquo;t make it today.
  - Sure, and you can ^leave ^earlier next time.
