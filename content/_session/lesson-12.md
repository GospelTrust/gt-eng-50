  - Today we are going to the ^zoo.
  - The zoo was a lot of fun.
  - They&rsquo;re so many ^animals there.
  - My ^favorite animal is the ^tiger. There are five tigers at this zoo.
  - We can&rsquo;t see the tigers up close because tigers are ^dangerous.
  - Tigers are so cool. And then there are huge ^elephants.
  - I wouldn&rsquo;t want to clean up after them.
  - No ^kidding. That would not be a job for me.
  - Yeah, can you ^imagine how much food they must eat in a day?
  - A lot of hay.
